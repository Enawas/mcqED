/**
 * Purpose: E2E tests covering RBAC scenarios in the UI. These tests
 * verify that users with different roles see or do not see certain
 * controls (Create, Import, Export, Audit, Edit) on the dashboard and
 * editor pages. Use Playwright test runner to automate browser
 * interactions.
 *
 * Note: This file is a skeleton. You must implement the test setup
 * to start the web application, log in with different roles and
 * assert the presence or absence of UI elements. See the README for
 * details on running e2e tests.
